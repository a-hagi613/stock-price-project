# Audio Files for Stock Alerts

## Required Sound Files

Place the following audio files in this directory:

- `cash-register.mp3` - Played for positive alerts (price increases, gains)
- `negative-alert.mp3` - Played for negative alerts (price drops, losses)
- `neutral-alert.mp3` - Played for neutral alerts (general news, volume alerts)

## Sources

You can find free sound effects from:
- [Freesound.org](https://freesound.org)
- [Zapsplat.com](https://zapsplat.com)
- [Mixkit.co](https://mixkit.co)

## Note

Audio files are optional for the prototype. The app will work without them, but they enhance the user experience by providing auditory feedback for different alert types.
